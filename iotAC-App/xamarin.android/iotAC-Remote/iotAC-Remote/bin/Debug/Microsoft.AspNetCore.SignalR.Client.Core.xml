            Returns an awaitable/awaiter that will ensure the continuation is executed
            asynchronously on the thread pool, even if the task is already completed
            by the time the await occurs.  Effectively, it is equivalent to awaiting
            with ConfigureAwait(false) and then queuing the continuation with Task.Run,
            but it avoids the extra hop if the continuation already executed asynchronously.
